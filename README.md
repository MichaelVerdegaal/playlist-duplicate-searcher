# About

This is a small script to find duplicates in two separate text files. This was originally created because i had two large youtube playlists of the same type available, and really didn't want to sort through it manually.

# Requirements

- An installation of Python 3.7+
- The fuzzywuzzy package (```pip install fuzzywuzzy``` or ```pip install fuzzywuzzy[speedup]``` in root python installation)

# Usage

Execute the Python script, the rest will follow.
